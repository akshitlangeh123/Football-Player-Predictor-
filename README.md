      <li>SVC</li>
      <li>Naive Bayes</li>
      <li>Decision Tree</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    For Regression:
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple Regression</li>
      <li>Polynomial regression</li>
      <li>SVR</li>
      <li>Decision Tree</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Interactive Dashboar(.pbix file) for visual analysis of Player's data and to generate scouting reports</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository in your local device and then into your google drive, if you want to use colab, otherwise local device works well and good</li>
  <li>Run Non-Professional.ipynb</li>
  <li>You can also use your custom player ratings prediction by creating a csv fila and giving player attributes but do make sure of the dataset format</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technologies:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pyhton(version 2.7+)</li>
  <li>Pandas to load data frame</li>
  <li>Power BI for visualization</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dataset:</h3>
